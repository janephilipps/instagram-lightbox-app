## Discussion

The technologies I used to build this app are: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I chose to use the Instagram API for image data. Without constraints, I would have used:

- Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness
- jQuery or Angular (or some other front-end framework) for cleaner DOM manipulation, ease of templating, and pre-built JSONP functionality

I chose to use JSONP to access Instagram's API to solve for cross-origin issues. I took inspiration for the lightbox functionality from this helpful [blog post](https://www.script-tutorials.com/how-to-create-a-lightbox-ultra-using-css-and-javascript/).
